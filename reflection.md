## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

I learned a lot of valuable lessons from this assignmnet. Firstly I got more comfortable with manipulating strings with built in functions when creating the pandaslib file. Next, the extraction file got me more familiar with loading and writing my own CSV files which I do not have much experience with in Python. The transform file had the biggest impact on my python knowledge. In this excersice I got a lot more comfortble with feature engineering, and creating new columns to join different dataframe; using the apply and lambda apply functions to use previously created functions on my data; and making pivot tables based on transformed data. I feel like this exercise greatly improved my python skills. The load exercise gave me some trouble, the directions where very vague and unclear, I tried creating my own bucket using the link but I don't think it worked correctly, honestly I had to use the code from the solutions file on this excercise as I didn't really know what to do here. Overall though I feel this assignment greatly improved my python skills.
